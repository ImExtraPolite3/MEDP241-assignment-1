          <h2>What's interesting to you in this article/work and why?</h2>
          <p>
            The article is fascinating because it explores a minimalist approach
            to web design, focusing on content over flashy technology. The
            author's philosophy of using basic HTML and CSS yet still creating
            meaningful and engaging content is refreshing in a tech-dominated
            world that often prioritizes complexity.

        <div id="question-two">
          <h2>Do you agree or disagree with the author, why?</h2>
          <p>
            I agree with the author's perspective that content is the heart of a
            website, and technology is just a medium. Simple, well-executed code
            can be just as impactful as more complex solutions, especially when
            the focus is on the message rather than the mechanics.
          </p>

        <div id="question-three">
          <h2>
            Other media (writings, images, videos, etc.) this article reminds
            you of, and how are they related?
          </h2>
          <p>
            This article reminds me of minimalist web design books and sites
            like "A List Apart," which emphasize content and clean design. It's
            also related to websites like the early versions of Craigslist or
            Wikipediaâ€”functional, content-driven, and not overly concerned with
            aesthetics.
