          <h2>What's interesting to you in this article/work and why?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I find this website interesting because it explores a minimalist
            approach to web design, focusing on content over flashy technology.
            The way the author uses basic HTML and CSS and is able to create
            meaningful and engaging content is refreshing in a tech-dominated
            world that often prioritizes complexity.

        <div id="question-two">
          <h2>Do you agree or disagree with the author, why?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I agree with the author's perspective that content is the heart of a
            website, and technology is just a medium. Simple, well-executed code
            can be just as impactful as more complex solutions.

        <div id="question-three">
          <h2>
            Other media (writings, images, videos, etc.) this article reminds
            you of, and how are they related?
          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            This website reminds me of minimalist web design sites such as
            <a href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>. I find
            similarities in the fact that both emphasize functionality over very
            artistic styling.
